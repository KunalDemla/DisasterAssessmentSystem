# DisasterAssessmentSystem

## Introduction
A drone is an aircraft without a human pilot onboard. The team plans to build a
disaster assessment drone for assessing and surveying disaster-stricken areas for damage
evaluation, search and rescue operations, and other related activities. Any disaster’s
aftermath requires evaluating the area affected from a safe distance. The analysis plays
a vital role in the evacuation of survivors. The information can further help conserve
significant buildings and resources that can be retrieved from the destroyed site. \
The captured images will be used to create digital maps, identify damaged
buildings and infrastructure, and assess the extent of the damage caused by the disaster.
It will cover large areas quickly, reach places difficult to access and provide real-time
data and images to response teams. <br>
The information will be collected in the form of encrypted. 
The encryption will serve the purpose of security. Super-resolution will be
applied to the collected images. The team will input the images into a machine-learning
model. The ML model and image processing algorithms will give a disaster analysis
report. The analysis will involve identifying damaged buildings, roads, bridges, and
other infrastructure and estimating the damage’s severity. The information will be used
to prioritize response efforts and allocate resources more effectively.
